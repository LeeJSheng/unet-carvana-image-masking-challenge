The challenge page can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/carvana-image-masking-challenge)

Download the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/carvana-image-masking-challenge/data)

The data should be unzipped into this directory where /train, /train_masks & /test contain the training images, training masks (labels) & testing data respectively

the unet_image_segmentation.ipynb notebook shows an implementation of U-Net using Keras API of Tensorflow.
